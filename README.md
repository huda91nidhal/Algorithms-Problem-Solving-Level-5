🔗 Doubly Linked List Class (C++ | OOP | Templates)
This repository contains Project 15: Doubly Linked List Class, part of
Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 5 on ProgrammingAdvices,
under the guidance of Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud.

This project represents a practical evolution of Data Structures – Level 1, where the Doubly Linked List was originally implemented using standalone functions.
Here, the same data structure is redesigned as a clean, reusable, object-oriented template class, suitable for real-world reuse and extension.

📌 Project Objective
Strengthen core Data Structures concepts through real implementation
Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) correctly and practically
Refactor functional DS code into a reusable library-style class
Practice clean, readable, and maintainable C++ code
Build a solid foundation for future advanced data structures
This project is part of the consolidation phase at the end of Part One of the roadmap.

🧠 Concepts Covered
Doubly Linked List fundamentals
Encapsulation and class responsibility
Template programming (template <class T>)
Pointer-based memory management
Traversal using Head and Current pointers
Incremental and reusable design
🏗️ Project Structure
📦 Project Structure
├── Data Structures
│ └── clsDblLinkedList.h
│
└── Source Files
└── main.cpp // Testing and usage examples

🔧 Design Notes
Node is implemented as an inner class inside clsDblLinkedList
Head is a public pointer that always references the first node
No need to pass Head to functions — list state is managed internally
Traversal is performed using a local Current pointer
Implemented as a template class to support multiple data types
Designed as a reusable library, not a one-time solution
✨ Supported Operations
Insert at beginning
Insert after a specific node
Insert at end
Find node by value
Delete a specific node
Delete first node
Delete last node
Traverse and print list contents
Index-based access and update
Reverse the list
🧪 Sample Usage
clsDblLinkedList<short> MyDblLinkedList;

MyDblLinkedList.InsertAtBeginning(1);
MyDblLinkedList.InsertAtBeginning(2);
MyDblLinkedList.InsertAtEnd(10);

MyDblLinkedList.PrintList();
📚 Learning Methodology
This project strictly follows the ProgrammingAdvices methodology:

No rushing or guessing

No adding features based on assumptions

Step-by-step instructor-driven implementation

Writing code first, then reviewing the official solution

Understanding why before extending or optimizing

This approach ensures strong fundamentals and long-term clarity.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Additional utility methods

Extended safety and validation

Better abstraction and encapsulation

Integration with other data structures

🧠 Final Note
Strong developers don’t rush to advanced topics. They build solid foundations that allow them to scale with confidence.

This project represents an important step in that journey. 🚀
